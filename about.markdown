I am a seasoned Ruby on Rails Engineer who has been using Ruby 2.2.10 and Rails since 5.0.1. I have a proven track record of building and launching successful products including 2 public Shopify Apps. I am always aware of the performance of the applications and how I can improve them. I am highly motivated to contribute, learn, and grow within the industry. My passion for new products and technologies drives me to collaborate effectively with diverse teams and deliver exceptional results.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, and staying active through various outdoor activities.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated the ability to adapt to new challenges and contribute effectively to the success of the projects I am involved in. I am excited to continue my journey in the tech industry and make a lasting impact on the products and teams I work with.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or job opportunities.
