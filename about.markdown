I am a seasoned **Ruby on Rails Engineer** with a proven track record of building and launching successful products. With a strong background in software development, I excel in working in flexible, agile environments that prioritize transparency and continuous improvement.

My passion for new products and technologies drives me to constantly learn and grow, both as an individual and as a team member. I am highly skilled in collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions that meet and exceed client expectations.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, and staying active through various outdoor activities.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated the ability to adapt to new challenges and contribute effectively to the success of the projects I am involved in. I am excited to continue my journey in the tech industry and make a lasting impact on the products and teams I work with.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or job opportunities.
