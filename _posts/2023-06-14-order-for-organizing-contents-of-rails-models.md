In Ruby on Rails, it's a good practice to follow a consistent order for organizing the contents of the models. Here's an order I always use:

- Constants
- Associations
- Scopes
- Validations
- Callbacks
- Enums
- Class methods
- Instance methods

```ruby
class Webhook < ApplicationRecord
  # Constants

  # Associations

  # Scopes

  # Validations

  # Callbacks

  # Enums

  # Class methods

  # Instance methods
end
```
